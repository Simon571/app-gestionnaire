# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## Running the app locally

To see your application running, you need to start the development server.

1.  Open the **Terminal** panel at the bottom of the Firebase Studio window.
2.  Type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3.  Wait for the command to finish. It will output a URL (like `http://localhost:9002`).
4.  Open this URL in your web browser to see your application.

*Forcing a small change for Git to pick up.*
